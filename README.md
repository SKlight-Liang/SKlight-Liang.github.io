# Personal Homepage

:gift: Welcome to my personal homepage! 
Here you can find information about my projects, skills, and interests.

Aha? You do not see them?
Hey, maybe I have not completed yet!


The architecture of the webpage originates from:

A very nice video tutorial, isn't it?

The basic framework is quite similar, but I still have made some improvements. For example, I added a transition animation for the change between day and night modes, making it appear more natural. And of course, I changed the structure a bit to make it more organized.

Well, you can see, I do not change more. So, feel free to explore the website and see what you can find!

As for the subsequent plan, I will try my best to improve the website continuously and add more content in the future! Though, it is not a very easy work for me ...
